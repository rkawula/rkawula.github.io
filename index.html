    <h1>Query for the IP Address</h1>
    <p>Typing a URL displays an animation where links are drawn between the nameservers, representing the way the DNS turns the URL into an IP address.
    <br>
    <p>If the URL has already been queried by the subnet, then the data is cached and the query does not need to run.
    <br>
    <p>If the URL's top level domain has already been queried by the subnet, then the top level domain is cached and the query takes a short-cut.
    <br>
    <p>Caching will be added so that when querying a duplicate URL, the animation stops at the Resolver cache.
